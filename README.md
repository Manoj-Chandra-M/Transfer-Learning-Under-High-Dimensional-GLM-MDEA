# Transfer-Learning-Under-High-Dimensional-GLM-MDEA
A transfer learning algorithm is selected and used to predict corrosion rates in chemical process industries, thereby initiating studies of transfer learning in chemical engineering domain. The aim of the algorithm is to enhance the fit on target data by taking information from useful source data.
